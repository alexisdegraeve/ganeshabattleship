The goal of the game is simple: **sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours**.  
Players strategically place their ships on a grid and then take turns guessing the locations of the opponent's ships.

### Main Rules
1. Each player has a grid (default 10x10).  
2. Each player places their ships on the grid:  
   - Aircraft Carrier (5 cells)  
   - Battleship (4 cells)  
   - Cruiser (3 cells)  
   - Submarine (3 cells)  
   - Destroyer (2 cells)  
3. Players take turns attacking.  
4. When a player hits an enemy ship, the cell is marked.  
5. The game continues until one player has sunk all the opponent's ships.
